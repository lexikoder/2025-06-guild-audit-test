## ðŸ›¡ Storage Collision / Upgradability Challenge

In this challenge, you'll explore how improperly managed storage in upgradeable contracts can be exploited to bypass intended permissions.

You're given a proxy setup where:

* The **owner** must opt-in before any upgrade is allowed.
* The **admin** can upgrade the proxy, **but only if** the owner has opted in.

However, there's a subtle vulnerability:
A particular variable that controls this "opt-in" status (`_optIn`) **shares the same storage slot** as part of a mapping in the implementation contract. This is what's known as a **storage collision**.

Using what you know about Solidityâ€™s storage layout and how `delegatecall` affects state, your task is to **find a way to change `_optIn` to `true`**â€”without the owner explicitly doing itâ€”and use that to **perform an unauthorized upgrade**.

To be specific, the storage slot where _optIn lives actually clashes with the balances mapping on the implementation contract. The address `0x47Adc0faA4f6Eb42b499187317949eD99E77EE85`, this allows admin to change _optIn to true by simply sending some tokens to that account thus allowing the admin to upgrade the contract against the will of the owner - you can easily calculate the storage slot for the balance mapping with: `keccack256(abi.encodePacked(uint256(address), uint256(slot))` where address is the key for the balance mapping and slot is the slot in which the mapping sits on storage.

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Goal:

Use the behavior of storage collisions to trick the contract into thinking the owner has opted in, allowing you to perform an upgrade as the admin.

---

### ðŸ§  Concepts to Focus On:

* **Storage layout in Solidity**
* **How mappings are stored in storage**
* **Delegatecall and proxy patterns**
* **Upgradeable contract design patterns**
* **How a specific key in a mapping maps to a storage slot**

If you understand how Solidity calculates mapping keys and how storage slots can accidentally overlap, you'll be well on your way.

### ðŸ§© Remember:

You donâ€™t need to brute force anything. This is a logic bug based on how storage is aligned in the proxy + implementation setup.
